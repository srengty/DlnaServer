#Basic implementation Obtain all music files according to the interface provided by android, 
and then implement DLNA Server through the protocol stack provided by CyberGarage. 
It is possible to browse music files shared by DLNA Server through DMC, 
but currently does not implement Http Server, so it is not possible to play media through DMC.
